## Introduction to Python
## What is Python

Python is different to most programming languages because it is a scripting language.  It is designed because of it is simplicity and the ability to produce high end applications such as web development and bash script. This is a perfect language for beginners, because it is a general purpose language.

## Why Use Python
Because the systems were built so long ago, IS needed a way in building new systems to help the existing old systems and make the caseworker’s life and the customers life a lot easier. The old systems were built using PL1 and Delphi languages 15 years ago.  So that is why the main languages we use are Python and Java, because it is a perfect programming language for beginners and so many apps on the web use it.  This makes it easy to follow the GDS guidelines of styling and to make it accessible too.

## How to Download Python
If you want to download Python on your home computer or on a non DITI machine, you need to go onto https://www.python.org
In the Land Registry we use Python 3, so it is recommended you install the latest version of Python 3 on whatever operating system you want. If you want to download it using your Land Registry DITI computer, you will have to raise a Marval Request on My Self Service. More information on how you can do this can be found on the HR Portal or via talking to your team lead, line manager or your buddy. You will have to ask permission from your team lead to see its okay with the software being installed and you put that relevant person in the Authorisation box. You will need your LRQ/ LLID of your machine so the relevant people can remotely install the software for you, without you needing to do anything.  Once it is been approved, the request gets taken to Service Desk and they will sort the rest out.

## Basic Programming Constructs
The first program that you write in any language is Hello World and it gives you a basic understanding of the syntax. To print a line to the program, you just use the keyword print, followed by the word you want to print in brackets. In this case, we would want to print:

```
print ("Hello World")
```
This is how it appears in Python.

## Whitespace

Whitespace is used in Python to structure code. It is different than languages such as Java or C# where indentation is done by using curly braces { }. In Python it is different.  Once a function is declared, you have to indent the code with four spaces in the first line and another 4 spaces before return. Here is an example:

```
def spam():
    eggs = 12
    return eggs

print spam()

```

## Variables
If you want to create a web app, they all involve storing and working with different types of data by using variables. Variables stores that particular data and gives it a specific name.
Eg:

```
variable = 5

```
This variable called variable now stores the number 5. How you name the variable it doesn’t matter. However it is strongly suggested that you start the first word of your variable in lower case.

## Data types
The data types in Python can be grouped into several classes. These are the following:

Int: non-limited length in Python 3
Long: A non-limited length which only exists in Python 2
Float: floating point numbers
Complex: complex numbers
str: String as a sequence of Unicode characters
bytes: Sequence of integers in the range of 0-255 in Python 3.x
dict: Python Dictionaries - element of a list is associated with a definition.
