      <p>“Since starting here I have been through a month training as an introduction to the Land Registry as well as to the course, the information I have gained from that month really showed in reflection, it was a very good introduction as it was mainly about settling us in but kept informing us about new subjects that none of us learnt before, I felt overall the Land Registry caters for its employees and isn’t afraid to use resources to go the extra length for just one person.”</p>

      <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

      <p>"When I started at the Land Registry, they gave us a friendly welcome and made sure we knew Land Registry process, governance structure and key concepts before we started in our teams in November 2016. We had a month’s training programme where we learnt about key concepts and we were introduced to key staff who we might be working with. They made us feel really comfortable straight away and since the other apprentices were in the same room too, I got to know all the other apprentices really well and we are all good friends too.  We did a mock Agile project during the one month training programme, so we can get used to the Agile Way of working.  It is great that we have got buddies in our teams too, so if we are struggling on anything to do with our job they can help us out. We got to know them before we started in our teams and we shadowed them for a day 2 weeks before and that helped me understand what I might be doing in my teams. We have daily standups where we find out what the teams have been doing and if they have been any problems. I feel like if we have a gap in our knowledge, I can speak to my line manager about it and they can put me on appropriate training courses/ guide me to websites. I have been learning Python, HTML/CSS, Javascript and many more programming languages. The team let me get involved with some tasks/user stories for the live project that they are currently working on too, so I can have a hands on look at the system and I can see with fresh eyes (since I haven’t been involved in development). This helps the team a lot, so they know what improvements they need to work on to make it User friendly. I feel like I can approach my buddy if I am struggling on any element of programming. I am also aware of who to go to in my team if I have a problem related to testing or requirements for example. It has been really enjoyable and I can’t wait to see what the rest of the year will bring."</p>
