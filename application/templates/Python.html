<h2 class="pyheader2">What is Python</h2> <p class="text">Python is different to most programming languages because it is a scripting language.  It is designed because of it is simplicity and the ability to produce high end applications such as web development and bash script. This is a perfect language for beginners, because it is a general purpose language. </p>

<h2 class="pyheader2">Why use Python?</h2>
 <p class="text">Because the systems were built so long ago, IS needed a way in building new systems to help the existing old systems and make the caseworkerâ€™s life and the customers life a lot easier. The old systems were built using <b>PL1</b> (programming Language) and <b>Delphi</b> (pre C# Language) 15 years ago.  So that is why the main languages we use are Python and Java, because it is a perfect programming language for beginners and so many apps on the web use it.  This makes it easy to follow the GDS guidelines of styling and to make it accessible too. </p>
<h2 class="pyheader2">How to Download Python</h2>
 <p class="text">If you want to download Python on your home computer or on a non DITI machine, you need to go onto https://www.python.org In the Land Registry we use <b>Python 3</b>, so it is recommended you install the latest  of Python 3 on whatever operating system you want. If you want to download it using your Land Registry DITI computer, you will have to raise a <b>Marval Request</b> on <b>My Self Service</b>. More information on how you can do this can be found on the <b>HR Portal</b> or via talking to your team lead, line manager or your buddy. You will have to ask permission from your team lead to see its okay with the software being installed and you put that relevant person in the Authorisation box. You will need your LRQ/ LLID of your machine so the relevant people can remotely install the software for you, without you needing to do anything.  Once it is been approved, the request gets taken to <b>Service Desk</b> and they will sort the rest out. </p>
